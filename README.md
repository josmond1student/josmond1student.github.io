# Root GitHub Pages Repository

I learned how to create a GitHub Pages site in a tutorial. This is my root site.

You can visit the site here: https://josmond1student.github.io/

I also learend that you can create project sites that can be viewed at the root domain followed by the repository name.
The trick is that all the path statements need the './' relative preceder to function properly.
